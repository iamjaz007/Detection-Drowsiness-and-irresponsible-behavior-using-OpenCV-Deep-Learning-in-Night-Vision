DRIVER SAFETY BY DETECTING DROWSINESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR IN NIGHT VISION USING OPENCV AND DEEP LEARNING
.
.

The aim and main objective of this research study is to identify distracted drivers and ensure drivers safety by detecting drowsiness and reckless conduct, as well as to create a system capable of estimating a driver's drowsiness and irresponsible behaviors. A real time detection of drowsiness by monitoring eye blinking rate, open and closed eyes, yawning. If an incident occurs, the warning system will activate, alerting the driver.

In this research work we proposed a system entitled Driver Safety  By Detecting Drowsiness and Irresponsible Behavior Using OpenCV and deep learning. The established system is able to detect drowsiness by monitoring the eyes, facial cues and yawning. Facial movements or expressions such as yawning and distracted states and irresponsible behaviors in different types of scenarios. Our proposed model has overcome the limitations of other models. Which we believe is a complete solution for those limitations. We have successfully integrated the detection of drowsiness and irresponsible behavior. Our model has obtained the overall best accuracy than any other proposed method both in detecting drowsiness and irresponsible behavior. We have worked with 2 classes associated with 5 different scenarios in the NTHU_DDD dataset and 10 classes in the State_farm_distracted_driver dataset. The framework involves the use of a CNN. 
This system works both in daylight and Night vision in several circumstances, Introducing effective real-time detection in night vision, with a real time drowsiness detection. Which judge the driver's alertness level on the basis of continuous eye closure, yawn and alarm the driver to prevent accidents due to drowsiness & distracted states and ensure driver safety. The system is highly effective and reliable. And we believe the chances of road accidents should be significantly reduced.
